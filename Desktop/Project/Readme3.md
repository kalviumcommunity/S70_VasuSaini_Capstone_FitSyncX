FitSyncX – AI-Powered Fitness & Nutrition Companion

FitSyncX is a smart fitness and nutrition platform designed to help users stay healthy by offering AI-driven calorie tracking, personalized meal plans, recipe suggestions, and progress tracking. It addresses common health challenges like inconsistent meal planning and lack of motivation by syncing diet and fitness goals in one intuitive platform. Users begin by creating a profile and entering their fitness goals. The platform then uses AI to calculate daily calorie needs and generate customized meal plans along with guided recipes and smart grocery lists. Progress can be tracked daily, and users earn rewards for consistency. Built with React.js and Tailwind CSS on the frontend, and Node.js with Express.js on the backend, it uses MongoDB for data storage and integrates OpenAI and Spoonacular APIs for smart features. Authentication is handled through Google OAuth and JWT, with deployment via Vercel and Railway or Render. FitSyncX stands out by combining AI intelligence with real-time motivation, aiming to be more than a tracker — a true fitness companion.
